        * (specifically: URI matches '^/twinkler/.+' but not '^/twinkler/.+\.(js|css|png)$')
        * this is because in normal usage, react-router will push eg /twinkler/show to history, but that will never reach CF...
        * ... but if the user reloads the page (âŒ˜+R, restarting their browser, etc) it'll ping CF with that URI
        * ... which will try to load /twinkler/show/index.html from S3, obviously fail
        * ... and return CF's standard 404 page. not the app itself.
        *     this wouldn't be improved by overriding default behaviour and trying to load /twinkler/show instead
        *     (as that's not an object so 404s too).
        *     one possible solution: get cloudfront to serve /twinkler/index.html
        *     and tell the app "hey go to /twinkler/show". that's kind of the dream; dunno if it's possible.
        * so the "eh, whatever" solution is to restart the app (using browser cache if applicable).
        * there's no specific code in this codebase to handle this - just something to be aware of with its production environment.
        * also the lambda's code isn't infrastructure-as-code and lives exclusively in the AWS dashboard. fight me.
