it'd also be cool to have the 'go back' button animate back to the 'submit' button, if there's one implemented

and it'd be rad to finally implement different colourschemes

and an animated transition (maybe have the text slide in from the top?)
maybe a loading thing on submit if it'll take more than half a second or so

could also centre small inputs instead of pinning them to the top left (simple stuff like `<form name="hi">`)
