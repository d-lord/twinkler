Reuse the majority of Twinkler's CSS and look

Switch to browser-side syntax analysis so it can be hosted statically

Make it a simple SPA?


load /, it renders the form
type stuff in and hit submit, it stays on / but renders the show template


it'd also be cool to have the 'go back' button animate back to the 'submit' button, if I'm keeping it

and it'd be rad to finally implement different colourschemes

and an animated transition (maybe have the text slide in from the top?)
maybe a loading thing on submit if it'll take more than half a second or so
